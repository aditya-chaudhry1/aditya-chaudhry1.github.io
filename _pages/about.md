I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Fisher College of Business at The Ohio State University. 

My primary research interests are asset pricing and macro-finance. My work focuses on:

1. Exploring the joint dynamics of subjective beliefs, asset demand, and asset prices
2. Using new empirical strategies as well as sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods to identify important structural parameters in asset pricing and macro-finance.
