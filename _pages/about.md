Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Fisher College of Business at The Ohio State University. My primary research interests are asset pricing and macro-finance. My work focuses on 1) using new empirical strategies as well as sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods to identify important structural parameters in asset pricing and macro-finance, and 2) exploring the implications of inelastic demand in financial markets for these fields. I obtained my Ph.D. in Finance Economics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
